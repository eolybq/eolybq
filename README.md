## Welcome to my GitHub! ‚ö°

- üå± I‚Äôm currently studying Mathematical and Statistical Methods in Economics at Masaryk University.
- üî≠ Now working on these personal projects:
  - [TSLA sentiment - price prediction](https://github.com/eolybq/tsla_sentiment_prediction), where I use traditional time series models and not so traditional machine learning models combined with unusual sentiment data to predict TSLA price.
  - At the same time I'm finishing [ModelApp](https://github.com/eolybq/ModelApp), which is website for fetching live stock financial data and then using the data to explore performance of different models with different settings.

### My journey üßë‚Äçüíª 
I'm passionate about technology, statistics and programming. I encountered programming during my undergraduate studies for the first time, got amazed and started learning on my own. I also started building my portfolio of projects. At that time, I focused on python and built my first projects, for instance [Snake Duel Game](https://github.com/eolybq/snake_duel_game) or [LoL style Duel Game](https://github.com/eolybq/lol_game). Then I moved to creating websites such as [TaskManager](https://github.com/eolybq/TaskManager) or later, more complex [FitApp](https://github.com/eolybq/FitApp) and [ChatApp](https://github.com/eolybq/ChatApp). I started to incline more and more towards statistics, as I enjoyed it in Uni and got interested in data science and machine learning. I learned R in Uni, + on my own, to come up with analyses like [Simulated Market Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/eolybq/market_sim_prediction) and [TSLA sentiment - price prediction](https://github.com/eolybq/tsla_sentiment_prediction). At that time, I also graduated in Economics from Masaryk University with my [Bachelor's Thesis](https://github.com/eolybq/bachelors_thesis). At the moment, I'm using python again, work on my next interesting projects and studying even more statistics and data science. I'm excited to learn new tools, data science techniques and to use them in practice.
