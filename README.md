## Welcome to my GitHub! ⚡

- 🌱 I’m currently studying Mathematical and Statistical Methods in Economics at Masaryk University.
- 🔭 Now working on these personal projects:
  - [Financial Volatility Forecastet](https://github.com/eolybq/financial_volatility_forecaster) is an End-to-End ML FastAPI project, which creates endpoint for real-time volatility predictions for any ticker available in Yahoo Finance. Endpoint /predict/{ticker} trains simple but reliable GARCH model on last 4 year data for chosen ticker, returns prediction for tommorow and store the prediciton in Neon.tech PostgreSQL database. Stored predicitons are then used to backwards manual test predictions in order to find any model drift in time. The project uses Docker to containerize application to be live deployed on HuggingFace Spaces.
  - [Documentation RAG LLM ChatBOT](https://github.com/eolybq/docs_rag_chat_bot) is a ChatBOT which answers with relevant and correct information from python libraries documentations. Project creates API endpoint for RAG retrieval from pgvector database containing embedded data. RAG pipeline for creating such database and to retrieve from it is created from scratch with python (from preprocessing documents, chunk splitting, embedding using OpenAI's models, to searching and prompting relevant information from database to LLM).
  - [TSLA sentiment - price prediction](https://github.com/eolybq/tsla_sentiment_prediction), where I use traditional time series models and not so traditional machine learning models combined with financial data and unusual sentiment data to predict TSLA price and to compare those conventional and unconventional approaches.
  - At the same time I'm finishing [ModelApp](https://github.com/eolybq/ModelApp), which is website for fetching live stock financial data and then using the data to explore performance of different models with different settings.

### My journey 🧑‍💻 
I'm passionate about technology, statistics and programming. I encountered programming during my undergraduate studies for the first time, got amazed and started learning on my own. I also started building my portfolio of projects. At that time, I focused on python and built my first projects, for instance [Snake Duel Game](https://github.com/eolybq/snake_duel_game) or [LoL style Duel Game](https://github.com/eolybq/lol_game). Then I moved to creating websites such as [TaskManager](https://github.com/eolybq/TaskManager) or later, more complex [FitApp](https://github.com/eolybq/FitApp) and [ChatApp](https://github.com/eolybq/ChatApp). I started to incline more and more towards statistics, as I enjoyed it in Uni and got interested in data science and machine learning. I learned R in Uni, + on my own, to come up with analyses like [Simulated Market Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/eolybq/market_sim_prediction) and [TSLA sentiment - price prediction](https://github.com/eolybq/tsla_sentiment_prediction). At that time, I also graduated in Economics from Masaryk University with my [Bachelor's Thesis](https://github.com/eolybq/bachelors_thesis). At the moment, I'm using python again, work on my next interesting projects and studying even more statistics and data science. I'm excited to learn new tools, data science techniques and to use them in practice.
