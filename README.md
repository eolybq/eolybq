## Welcome to my GitHub! ⚡

- 🌱 I’m currently studying Mathematical and Statistical Methods in Economics at Masaryk University.
- 🔭 Now working on these personal projects:
  - **[FinFetcher](https://github.com/eolybq/finfetcher)** is an end-to-end Python solution available through PyPI that addresses market data inconsistency. It functions as a robust `yfinance` wrapper designed to clean OHLC data by removing incomplete candles—a common issue when fetching data while markets are active. The package natively manages various asset types (equities, cryptocurrencies, forex, and ETFs) and their respective timezones. Furthermore, it accurately calculates the date of the following trading session, accounting for specific market opening schedules to ensure data continuity.
  - [Financial Volatility Forecaster](https://github.com/eolybq/financial_volatility_forecaster) is an End-to-End Quantitative Pipeline FastAPI project, which creates endpoint for real-time volatility predictions for any ticker available in Yahoo Finance. Endpoint /predict/{ticker} trains simple but reliable GARCH model on last 4 year data for chosen ticker, returns prediction for tommorow and store the prediciton in Neon.tech PostgreSQL database. Stored predicitons are then used for backwards manual evaluation. The project uses Docker to containerize application to be live deployed on HuggingFace Spaces.
  - At the same time I'm finishing [ModelApp](https://github.com/eolybq/ModelApp), which is website for fetching live stock financial data and then using the data to explore performance of different Machine Learning / Statistics models with different settings.

### My journey 🧑‍💻 
I'm passionate about technology, Machine Learning, Statistics and programming. I encountered programming during my undergraduate studies for the first time, got amazed and started learning on my own. I also started building my portfolio of projects. At that time, I focused on Python and built my first projects, for instance [Snake Duel Game](https://github.com/eolybq/snake_duel_game) or [LoL style Duel Game](https://github.com/eolybq/lol_game). Then I moved to creating websites such as [TaskManager](https://github.com/eolybq/TaskManager) or later, more complex [FitApp](https://github.com/eolybq/FitApp) and [ChatApp](https://github.com/eolybq/ChatApp). I started to incline more and more towards Statistics, as I enjoyed it in Uni and got interested in Data Science and Machine learning. I learned **R** in Uni, + on my own, to come up with analyses like [Simulated Market Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/eolybq/market_sim_prediction) and [TSLA sentiment - price prediction: Part 1](https://github.com/eolybq/tsla_sentiment_prediction). At that time, I also graduated in Economics from Masaryk University with my [Bachelor's Thesis](https://github.com/eolybq/bachelors_thesis). At the moment I'm studying even more **Machine Learning**, Statistics and Data Science in general. I'm using **Python** again, work on my next interesting projects such as **[TSLA sentiment - price prediction: Part 2](https://github.com/eolybq/tsla_sentiment_prediction)**, **[PyDocs AI](https://github.com/eolybq/pydocs_ai)** or [Bayes vs Machine Learning](https://github.com/eolybq/bayes_vs_ml). I'm excited to learn new tools (**Docker** and **Linux** at the moment), data science techniques and to use them in practice.
