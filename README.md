## Welcome to my GitHub!‚ö°

- üå± I‚Äôm currently studying Mathematical and Statistical Methods in Economics at Masaryk University.
- üî≠ Now working on these personal projects:
  - [Project TSLA price prediction](https://github.com/eolybq/tsla_sentiment_prediction), where I use traditional time series models and not so traditional machine learning models combined with unusual sentiment data to predict TSLA price.
  - At the same time I'm finishing [ModelApp](https://github.com/eolybq/ModelApp), which is website for fetching live stock financial data and then using the data to explore different models with different settings performance.

### About meüßë‚Äçüíª 
I'm passionate about technology, statistics and programming. I encountered programming during my undergraduate studies for the first time, got amazed and started learning on my own. I also started building my portfolio of projects. At that time, I focused on python and built my first projects, for instance [Snake Duel Game](https://github.com/eolybq/snake_duel_game) or [LoL style Duel Game](https://github.com/eolybq/lol_game). Then I moved to creating websites such as [TaskManager](https://github.com/eolybq/TaskManager) or later, more complex [FitApp](https://github.com/eolybq/FitApp) and [ChatApp](https://github.com/eolybq/ChatApp). I started to incline more and more towards statistics, as I enjoyed it in Uni and got interested in data science and machine learning. I learned R in Uni, + on my own, to come up with analyses like [Simulated Market Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/eolybq/market_sim_prediction) and [TSLA price prediction](https://github.com/eolybq/tsla_sentiment_prediction). At that time, I also graduated in Economics from Masaryk University with my [Bachelor's Thesis](https://github.com/eolybq/bachelors_thesis). At the moment, I'm using python again, work on my next interesting projects and studying even more statistics and data science.
