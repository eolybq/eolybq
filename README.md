## Welcome to my GitHub!⚡

- 🌱 I’m currently studying Mathematical and Statistical Methods in Economics at Masaryk University.
- 🔭 Currently working on
  - [Project TSLA price prediction](https://github.com/eolybq/tsla_sentiment_prediction), where I use traditional time series models and not so traditional machine learning models combined with unusual sentiment data to predict TSLA price.
  - At the same time I'm finishing [ModelApp](https://github.com/eolybq/ModelApp), which is website for fetching live stock financial data and then using the data to explore different models with different settings performance.
